# Mall Customer Segmentation with KMeans and DBSCAN

This project demonstrates the clustering of mall customers based on their spending habits and income using the `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset. The project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), implements KMeans and DBSCAN clustering techniques, and deploys a web app built with Streamlit using Docker and Render.

## Files in the Repository

1. **Clustering.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing EDA, KMeans, and DBSCAN clustering implementation.
2. **Dockerfile**: Used to containerize the Streamlit application.
3. **Mall_Customers.csv**: Dataset containing information about mall customers.
4. **app.py**: Streamlit web application script to visualize clustering results and interact with the data.
5. **k_means.pkl**: Saved KMeans clustering model.
6. **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies for the project.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the structure, distribution, and relationships in the data.
- **Clustering**: KMeans and DBSCAN applied to cluster customers based on two variables (Annual Income and Spending Score).
- **Interactive Web Application**: Visualizes clustering results and allows user interaction via a Streamlit app.
- **Containerization**: The application is containerized using Docker and deployed on Render for easy accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Data analysis, clustering, and web application
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`
- Docker: Containerization
- Render: Cloud deployment platform
